# DIABETES PREDICTION MODEL

A system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not, depending upon factors such as Pregnancies, Glucose and Blood Pressure levels, Skin Thickness, Insulin,	BMI etc.
For this project a Machine Learning Model is made using Support Vector Machine model for prediction.
